# Project Todos
Here is my Todo list that I made in the Tecnigo Bootcamp, It was some strugles but I am proud of the final result!
This was a tuff week with React Redux, I created new slices and practicing actions and payloads. Created reducers and learned how to structure reduce store. I  get to know dispatch and select even a bit more and yeh, it was allot new and old learning so werry good practise!
## The problem

I had hard to understand how the reducers worked but I will learn, just a mather off time.
